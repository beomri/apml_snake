Answer to Q6:
in order for the learner to know about the reward to cross the bridge, it
needs to get there first. If it's completely random, it has 0.25 chance to advance.
The probabily to get to the other side is 0.25^6 = 1/4096. So the probabiliy after 50
iteration is 25/2048 < 99%. But if it's not completly random, then the probabily will
be even smaller, since it will reach the start of the bridge and remember it has a good
value to return to.
